# RCFGL
## Rapid C/Python implementation of CFGL
The package provides a rapid implementation of Conditionally Fused Graphical Lasso algorithm. 
Unlike the original paper and the associated package, RCFGL can handle more than three 
different categories. Refer to the Python notebook titled as "CFGL_wf_notebook.ipynb" to get a walk-through on how to use the package. If you have problem viewing the ipython notebook, please click on this link instead, https://rb.gy/3lgf88 .
